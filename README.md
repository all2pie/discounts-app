## Improvements

These are the things that i would have implemented if this was a proper project:

- Used Fastify instead of Express for better performance
- Used GraphQL instead of REST
- Used the `@nestjs/config` to handle the configurations
- Added proper credential's for the Database
- Used Async config class for Mongoose config
- Used separate modules for Category and Product
